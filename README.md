Task
We use map data from various ad platforms into a single one. it can help marketers with questions like: "Where clicks better on facebook or tiktok?"
Imagine that model behind dashboard, is lost somehow. You need to rebuilt it. You have: â€” raw data from the ad systems (seeds folder), - the MCDM table structure for this report, - and dashboard

In this situation, we've got checklist that you can follow (or not): - Begin a new project in dbt Cloud, utilizing Google Big Query as the DWH. - Use the raw data from the ad platforms and the MCDM table structure for the ads_basic_performance report.

I have transformed the data using DBT Cloud and BigQuery DWH and recreated table report using google looker studio.

If you want to make changes in the dataset (i.e adding columns into the dataset) you should refer to the models/final.sql and adjust the operations there.
